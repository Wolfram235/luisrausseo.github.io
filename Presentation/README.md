# CS 4331 - Student Choice Presentation

## LABSTER

Laboratory Simulations for Educators to Empower their STEM Students.

### What is LABSTER?

LABSTER is a simulation platform that allow students to perform scientific experiments using a browser or a VR headset. Students can now perform advanced experiments to achieve core science learning outcomes outlined within their classes. They can explore many different science topics at their own pace and level of difficulty.

### Where is it used? What are best suited applications?

It used in several higher education institutions to supplement STEM related courses. It allows students to perform experiments which complement the theory that they have in class.

### The basics: How does it work?

Basically, is just a simulation that can be run in any computer/smartphone with or without a VR headset. Students can access a shared virtual space in which can perform different experiments related to the class that they are taking. 

### Why is it a good use of VR? Why is it unique? What’s cool about it?

LABSTER uses VR technology to create an immersive environment in which students can feel certain degree of reality in the experiments. LABSTER go a few steps beyond allowing its users to participate in a dynamic learning experience by simulating things like molecule interactions. These experiences allow students to take a more visual and comprehensive approach on the experiments that there are doing. 

### Critique on strengths and weaknesses/issues such as testing flaws or technical flaws. Is there still more to do?

#### Benefits:

* It allows to perform experiments without the risks.
* Enables universities to save money by not using reactives or disposal methods.
* Has LMS integration (i.e. Blackboard).
* Can be used in computers, smartphones with or without a VR headset.

#### Weaknesses:

*Limited to what programmers set up as the experiment's outcome.
*No haptic feedback, which can be solved by using devices such as the Glove One.

### Can this lead to varying degrees of simulator sickness including nausea, fatigue, headache, eyestrain, vertigo, and dizziness? What is your rating on the scale from 0 to 10?

It is estimated that a value of 2 out of 10 for this technology. Even though is not a rapid movement simulation, the long sessions required to complete a experiment may be too much for certain people to handle. 

### What are the similar/related applications?

Similar applications could be: OSSO VR, NVIDIA HoloDeck or ENGAGE. These platforms are also simulations dedicated to collaborative research and learning training.

* [ENGAGE VR](http://immersivevreducation.com/engage-education-platform/)

### Are there any other potential applications of the technique/device?

Other potential applications could include a collaborative research platform or having the ability to test experiments outside the ‘programmed-only one outcome’ environment. 

## Conclusion

* It is a great tool to educate students regarding STEM related experiments since allow dynamic interaction without the hazards.
* Can be implemented in current universities’ programs to provide a more comprehensive approach on science as an affordable solution.
