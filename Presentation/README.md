# CS 4331 - Student Choice Presentation

## LABSTER

Laboratory Simulations for Educators to Empower their STEM Students.

### What is LABSTER?

LABSTER is a simulation platform that allow students to perform scientific experiments using a browser or a VR headset. Students can now perform advanced experiments to achieve core science learning outcomes outlined within their classes. They can explore many different science topics at their own pace and level of difficulty.

### Where is it used? What are best suited applications?

It used in several higher education institutions to supplement STEM related courses. It allows students to perform experiments which complement the theory that they have in class.

### The basics: How does it work?

Basically, is just a simulation that can be run in any computer/smartphone with or without a VR headset. Students can access a shared virtual space in which can perform different experiments related to the class that they are taking. 

### Why is it a good use of VR? Why is it unique? Whatâ€™s cool about it?

LABSTER uses VR technology to create an immersive environment in which students can feel certain degree of reality in the experiments. LABSTER go a few steps beyond allowing its users to participate in a dynamic learning experience by simulating things like molecule interactions. These experiences allow students to take a more visual and comprehensive approach on the experiments that there are doing. 

### Critique on strengths and weaknesses/issues such as testing flaws or technical flaws. Is there still more to do?

Benefits:

* It allows to perform experiments without the risks.
* Enables universities to save money by not using reactives or disposal methods.
* Has LMS integration (i.e. Blackboard).
* Can be used in computers, smartphones with or without a VR headset.

Weaknesses:

*Limited to what programmers set up as the experiment's outcome.
*No haptic feedback, which can be solved by using devices such as the Glove One.
